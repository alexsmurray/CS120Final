# CS120Final

There are two games to choose from.
Music Puzzle and Simon Says

Music Puzzle:
  Generates a random 4 note code.
  Notes are only used once in the sequence.
  Use the clues to determine the notes and order need to solve the puzzle.
  You have 3 free attempts before losing on the 4th.

Simon Says:
  There are 4 colored buttons each with its own sound.
  Once you start the trial, it will generate a single code for you to repeat.
  If you guess that correctly, it will get harder by randomly making a new sequence and adding an additional note each time.
  The goal is to keep going until you fail.
  Highscores are kept.
